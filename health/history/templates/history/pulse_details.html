          What is a normal heart rate?
        </h3>
        <p>
          A normal heart rate, when you're not being active, 
          is generally between 60 â€“ 100 beats per minute. 
          This is called your resting heart rate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Athletes or people who are very fit may have resting
          heart beats of less than 60 bpm.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you're active, your heart beats faster to get
          more oxygen to your working muscles. The harder 
          your body is working, the faster your heart will beat. 
          For example, your heart rate when you're sprinting 
          will be much faster than your heart rate when you're 
          walking. If you're exercising hard, it's normal for your 
          heart rate to get up to 160 beats per minute or more.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other things that can make your heart beat 
          faster, like caffeine, nicotine, recreational drugs 
          and some kinds of medications. Your heart will also 
          beat faster when you feel strong emotions, like anxiety, 
          fear or excitement.
